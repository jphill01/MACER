Description: Molecular Acquisition, Cleaning, and Evaluation in R (MACER) is an R package to assist biological researchers in assembling taxonomically and marker focused molecular sequence data set. MACER accepts a list of genera as a user input and uses NCBI-GenBank and BOLD as resources to download and assemble molecular sequence datasets. These datasets are then assembled by marker, aligned, trimmed, and cleaned. The use of this package allows the publication of specific parameters to ensure reproducibility. The MACER package has four core functions and an example run through using all of these functions can be found in the associated repository MACER_example <https://github.com/rgyoung6/MACER_example>.
